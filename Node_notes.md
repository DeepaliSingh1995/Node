* Node is a **"SERVER ENIVRONMENT"** not a programming language !
* Why server environment ?
>  - **Node JS internally uses the code of "JAVASCRIPT"** like JS runs on browser in the **V8 engine** just like Crome's V8 engine but Node has inbuilt V8 engine to execute the code.
> - We can connect Database in Node ; handles file system as well  and it runs on server.
> - It is open source (i.e. we can contribute directly to node community).

* Node is mostly used for API
* Node is written in C, C++ and Javascript.
* Current version : 21.0.0
